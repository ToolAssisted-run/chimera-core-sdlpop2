/* coro.c - SDLPoP2's coroutines (source/coro.h) for a core, in place of its
 * own coro.c (ucontext, which musl does not have, over a malloc'd stack).
 *
 * The program shell and the story scenes keep the DOS program's blocking loops
 * and run on stacks of their own, handing control back where the program would
 * wait. Nothing is threaded: a switch saves exactly what the System V ABI says
 * a callee must preserve (rbx, rbp, r12-r15, the MXCSR and the x87 control
 * word) on the stack being left, and stores that stack pointer. Everything a
 * suspended coroutine holds is on its own stack, which is guest memory like any
 * other, so a savestate taken between two steps carries it whole.
 *
 * The stacks are asked for with MAP_STACK: miniBox tracks writes by protecting
 * pages, and on Windows a fault on the page the stack pointer is in cannot be
 * delivered unless the sandbox was told the page is a stack (miniBox
 * memblock.c; the x68k and ares cores both died on Windows without it).
 * Natively the flag costs nothing.
